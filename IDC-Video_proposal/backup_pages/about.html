        <h3>What we offer</h3>
        <p>We offer numerous engineering video courses for self-paced training. The videos are situated on this website, and can be accessed 24/7 for a period of 2 years.</p>
        <p>Once the two years have expired for the course, a minor renewal fee will need to be paid to extend the course further. The <a href="http://http//idc-online.ac.za/videozar/course-list.html"><em>Course List</em></a> page will display all the relevant prices of each individual course.</p>
        <p>Most of the courses have one or two eBooks attached. These collaborate with the videos, allowing you to further enhance your understanding about the topics.</p>

        <p>We use Vimeo as a host for the videos, as we have determined it to be the most effective and simplest video streaming website.</p>
